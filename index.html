        <h1>Happy Birthday Vivian!</h1>
        <p>
          I hope you are having a wonderful birthday with your sister and
          congratulations on your new job!! A part of me is hoping you end up in
          a city near me but a part of me wants an excuse to visit Hawaii!
          Either way, I hope you end up in a city you'll love!
        </p>
        <p>
          Last few months, I've been wondering what a good gift would be. I
          thought maybe I could ship something to SF, but I was worried you
          wouldn't be there. And I didn't want to get something that you would
          have to carry to Idaho (I mean Seattle).
        </p>
        <p>
          I know gift cards are lame so I hand picked a few things that I
          thought you would like (like a tailored catalog?). Hope we can spend a
          birthday together in the next few years, so I can give you something
          in person!
        </p>
