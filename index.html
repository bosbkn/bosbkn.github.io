      <h1>Happy Birthday Vivian!</h1>
      <p>
        I hope you are having a wonderful birthday with your sister and
        congratulations on your new job!! A part of me is hoping you end up in a
        city near me but a part of me wants an excuse to visit Hawaii! Either
        way, I hope you end up in a city you'll love!
      </p>

        Last few months, I've been wondering what a good gift would be. I
        thought maybe I could ship something to SF, but I was worried you
        wouldn't be there. And I didn't want to get something that you would
        have to carry to Idaho (I mean Seattle).

        I know gift cards are lame so I hand picked a few things that I thought
        you would like (like a tailored catalog?). Hope we can spend a birthday
        together in the next few years, so I can give you something in person!
      </p>
